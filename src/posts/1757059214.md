added simple styling to the blog feed page to make it look like my own personal web canvas.

html is 99% enough for my design since i surrender css to water.css. this means semantic markup alone gives my page both structure, meaning, and style, in contrast to additionally fiddling with custom classes which would only give me more style control.

sounds paradoxical for a designer to not care about stylistic control; but i think it's my maturing understanding of what design actually is and is not. I currently believe both these things at once: good design is moderate, and bad design is excessive. good design is implicit, and bad design is explicit.

nextup:
- render reply-to/bookmark-of/like-of post contexts
- save tags to frontmatter, and render
