<div>i build a lot with ai; including recently webmentions, and micropub support for this microblog. however, my process working with ai to date has felt slow and blunt-force. inspired by this article: <a href="https://wuu73.org/blog/aiguide1.html">https://wuu73.org/blog/aiguide1.html</a>, i set out to add more structure, and smarts into my ai-building process.<br><br><strong>old process:</strong><br>1. one-shot: copy/pasting code and problem into chatgpt<br><br><strong>new process intention: </strong><br>- <strong>leverage specialists, not generalists:</strong> assign the right models for the right tasks i.e. strategy-building vs code writing —&nbsp;<br>- <strong>leverage chain-of-thinking, not one-shot</strong>: break down complex requests into a chain of smaller, specfic subtasks i.e. plan, design, execute<br>- <strong>leverage diversity</strong>: add another ai-mind in planning stage, and combine the best-of-all worlds<br><br><strong>new process:</strong><br>1. select a feature fit for the ai to develop (reply-context), and get a rough idea what the solution looks like.<br>2. bundle current codebase, describe new feature request, design preferences, and ask for a high-level strategy from smartest AIs: gpt-5, and gemini 2.5 pro<br>3. compare &amp; combine best-of-both-worlds strategies based on the original request, using gemini 2.5 pro (large context window). <br>4. ask for a PRD with exactly what needs to be done. Then ask for a TODO.md doc with tasks, and subtasks to give to an AI based on the PRD. <br>5. Install VSCode w/Cline, add the TODO.md to the codebase, and task gpt4.1 to execute each step and mark it done. <br><br><strong>results:</strong><br>- completed all 21 steps ~30 minutes ~ 3€ spent in addition to daily credit allowance. <br>- created: reply-context cache, context fetcher script, context-citation component, and linked in each relevant layout.. <br><img src="https://blog.jamesandrewscoulter.com/images/1757154398_RackMultipart20250906-114-29ulr8.png" alt="Example reply-to post citing a note-post"><br><strong>reflections and next steps<br></strong>was it worth it? hell yeah. gave me a greater sense of security having 2, competing, ai minds work out a master plan, and then a sense of awe and satisfaction watching it autonomously execute.<br><br>1. it looks about 85% ready. There's a few important pieces not working as expected, so debugging seems normal, and necessary. But a conservative 1h spent to get 85%, when it might have taken me 4h previously, seems like a great saving. <strong>next step: </strong>repeat the process for debugging. <br><br>2. maligned expectations between tokens spent in cline vs openai. i suspect there's a lot of context bloat getting sent behind the scenes, so opportuntiies to improve execution economy. <strong>next steps: </strong>find and edit the cline .gitignore</div>
