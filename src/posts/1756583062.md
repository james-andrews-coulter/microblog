Yikes. Been out with what I think was COVID for a good 5 days, and now only just starting to feel normal again. 

I've returned to my indieweb microblog project, and added some new features:
- built a sitemap generation script
- built a script that fetches webmentions at build time and writes each post's data to a json file i can pull into a component
- built a nicely rendering in-post webmention component

see it in action here: https://blog.jamesandrewscoulter.com/posts/1756196344/

next up
- add a build-time script that sends webmentions for a newly published post

later:
- sign up to mastodon and configure bridgy

it's been a journey, and i still have a way to go. From 11ty site generation > microformats2 markup > micropub setup > now webmention setup. All in the name of pitching my own tent on the indieweb, and making the internet a better place again.
