scaffolding is up! vite, tailwind, react, javascript and shadcn all working together.

learnings/surprises:
- Zeplin is great, and i'm rooting for them > FIgma, but overkill for an indie build using a stock component system. 
- impressed at how efficient one can design fast with a ui kit, but confused by a) why there's not many well maintained OSS kits for popular frameworks around b) why there's not a more automated way to go from ui-kit designs to code
- react is not as scary as i thought it might be coming from vue. logic wise - it's all very understandable.

next up: 
- let's make those buttons interactive, and give it some memory so i can pilot it during tomorrow's gym session
