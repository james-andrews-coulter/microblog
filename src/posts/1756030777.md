had a bit too much fun using shadcn/ui components to conceptualise a minimal mobile web lift logger. 

it’s compact, opinionated, and low low-touch, perfect for quick recall and capture so i can stay present and performant

my favourite features:
- default values for each exercise populated from the last session’s via localstorage - means i can focus on just beating last time
- no typed inputs - sweaty, shaky thumbs on small screens make typing hard. and how much can these values change from last time anyway? a decrementing button activates the exercise, rewards good, and penalises subpar performance
- no boring start new session, finish session - sessions happen one time every few days - new clear session daily
- single screen, means no navigation between pages risking resetting values

next up: handover to dev james via Zeplin
