committing to learn react. why?
- fill gap in my stack (ui kit design to dev handover)
- first oss contribution
- portfolio piece

constraints:
- 8h over next 7 days
- free, just my labour
- must use tailwind, and react
- simulate whole process: concept > deploy

requirements
- solution should add real daily value to my life / solve a real everyday need
- solution should be justified by a custom react/web project i.e why is nothing else a solution
- ai-use should simulate real company use, and each line explainable by me i.e hand code assist not full app generate 

deliverables
- portfolio case study online with link to live app, github repo, and design/development process docs

success criteria
- first hand experience modern design > dev handover process


app idea: workout session logger
