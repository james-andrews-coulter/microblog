learned about a great tool called Repomix today that i can use to give source code-wide context to a web llm. 

it’s great because until now i’ve been copy pasting code into a long conversation, which is prone to hallucination and hacked solutions.

now i just bundle all relevant files into a markdown file, and the ai can reach all corners of my codecs to give me precise, accurate solutions.

so far i’ve used it to:
- clean up my failed ‘send webmention’ script
- add a minimal stylesheet i can easily modify and maintain

i still need to practise dividing ai jobs between architecture, and implementation. there are probably models optimised for these roles, but i can probably just focus on the workflow in chatgpt.

while i wait for my mastodon account to mature to configure bridgy, i’ll use this new tool to refactor my codebase and implement some basic styles
